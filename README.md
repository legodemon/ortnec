#Please make the HTML markup for given task.psd file 


##Criteria of satisfaction (Please read all the points before you begin):

1. Implement the HTML layout as closer to the given PSD as you can (fonts, sizes, menus etc.). Pixel-perfect is desirable but not necessary. 

2. Feel free to use technologies which are described in the vacancy, 3rd party solutions and icon fonts, it is up to you. (Bootstrap grid model, Glyphicon icon font, JS for roll-up menu, as well as you can make them only using CSS). 
If you feel that default icons are not ok - use 3rd party icon font.

3. Default (and maximum) resolution for the layout is 940px. If you can make this layout responsive for different screen resolutions - it will be considered as a plus. You can hide or change the position for some elements in a small screens)

4. Layout should be cross-browser for all modern popular browsers (IE11+)

5. Please use test mp4 video and make the player area playable. You are free to use any 3rd party player solution you like, or use just the native html5 player.

6. *Optional. Implementation of the custom player controls, which are shown in the mockup. That includes: custom play/pause control, custom volume bar with mute/unmute states, current/total time). If you do not mind to implement this point, just leave the controls area blank and use the default ones. Implementation will be considered as a plus.

7. *Optional. Again, implementation of this will be considered as a plus. In attach you can see data.json file. It contains all the necessary data to render this page and have some dynamic (videos should be switchable. Clicking on video thumbnail you should re-init the player and download section with the new content). You can use any solution you like (e.g. React+ES6, Angular+TypeScript or any other combination except jQuery. Try to keep it simple).

##Approximate time for implementation:
### ~ 3-4 hours for points 1-5
### ~ 6 hours for points 1-6
### ~ 8 hours for points 1-7
